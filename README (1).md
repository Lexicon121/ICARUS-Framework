# ICARUS Framework for Unmanned Systems

The ICARUS framework provides a comprehensive approach to securing drones and robotic systems by integrating principles from both the MITRE ATT&CK and SPARTA frameworks. Implementing such a framework would require collaboration with industry experts, manufacturers, and regulatory bodies, as well as continuous research and adaptation to the evolving threat landscape.

## Overview

- **I - Integrated Threat Intelligence**: Understand and share information about potential adversaries and evolving threats targeting unmanned systems.
- **C - Cybersecurity Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**: Define and document the objectives, methods, and real-world instances of potential adversaries targeting unmanned systems.
- **A - Aerial and Aquatic Defense**: Implement strategies to ensure aerial drones follow secure flight paths and protect against communication disruptions.
- **R - Robotic System Resilience**: Enhance the physical and software security of robotic systems and establish recovery protocols.
- **U - Unmanned System Operations**: Define standard operating procedures, implement strong authentication mechanisms, and monitor for operational anomalies.
- **S - Systems Monitoring and Response**: Continuously monitor system components, develop incident response plans, and conduct forensic investigations.
